# squab

[![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/zaeleus/squab/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zaeleus/squab/actions)

**squab** performs gene expression quantification by counting the number of
aligned records that intersects a set of features.

The original goal of this project is to provide a faster alternative to
[htseq-count]. It uses similar counting rules and outputs a compatible data
table.

[htseq-count]: https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/master/count.html

## Installation

Install [Rust] and use `cargo` to install `squab`.

```
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/zaeleus/squab.git
```

[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

## Usage

squab has one subcommand: `quantify`.

### `quantify`

`quantify` performs gene expression quantification by counting the number of
times aligned records intersect known gene annotations.

```
Gene expression quantification

Usage: squab quantify [OPTIONS] --annotations <ANNOTATIONS> <SRC>

Arguments:
  <SRC>  Input alignment file

Options:
      --with-secondary-records
          Count secondary records (BAM flag 0x100)
      --with-supplementary-records
          Count supplementary records (BAM flag 0x800)
      --with-nonunique-records
          Count nonunique records (BAM data tag NH > 1)
      --strand-specification <STRAND_SPECIFICATION>
          Strand specification [default: auto] [possible values: none, forward, reverse, auto]
  -t, --feature-type <FEATURE_TYPE>
          Feature type to count [default: exon]
  -i, --id <ID>
          Feature attribute to use as the feature identity [default: gene_id]
      --min-mapping-quality <MIN_MAPPING_QUALITY>
          [default: 10]
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>
          Output destination
  -a, --annotations <ANNOTATIONS>
          Input annotations file (GFF3)
      --threads <THREADS>
          Force a specific number of threads
  -h, --help
          Print help (see more with '--help')
```

The default output is a tab-delimited text file with two columns: the feature
identifier (string) and the number of reads (integer) from the input alignment
that overlap it. This file is compatible as output from htseq-count, meaning it
includes statistics in the trailer.

## Examples

### Count features (exons by gene ID)

```
$ squab \
    quantify \
    --annotations annotations.gff3.gz \
    --output sample.counts.tsv \
    sample.bam
```

### Count featues (genes by gene name)

```
$ squab \
    quantify \
    --annotations annotations.gff3.gz \
    --feature-type gene \
    --id gene_name \
    --output sample.counts.tsv \
    sample.bam
```

## Limitations

  * Counts are taken only as the union of matched feature sets, i.e., reads that
    overlap any part of the feature is considered once.
  * For paired end alignments, a read that matches itself before a mate is
    found replaces the previously known record.

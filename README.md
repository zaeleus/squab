# noodles squab

[![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles-squab/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles-squab/actions)

**noodles squab** performs gene expression quantification by counting the
number of aligned records that intersects a set of features. Output can be the
raw counts or normalized counts in TPM (transcripts per million) or FPKM
(fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads).

The original goal of this project is to provide a faster alternative to
[htseq-count]. It uses similar counting rules and outputs a compatible data
table.

## Installation

Install [Rust] and use `cargo` to install `noodles-squab`.

```
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles-squab.git
```

[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install


## Usage

noodles-squab has two subcommands: `quantify` and `normalize`.

### `quantify`

`quantify` performs gene expression quantification by counting the number of
times aligned records intersect known gene annotations.

```
noodles-squab-quantify
Gene expression quantification

USAGE:
    noodles-squab quantify [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <bam> --annotations <file> --output <file>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help                          Prints help information
    -V, --version                       Prints version information
        --with-nonunique-records        Count nonunique records (BAM data tag NH > 1)
        --with-secondary-records        Count secondary records (BAM flag 0x100)
        --with-supplementary-records    Count supplementary records (BAM flag 0x800)

OPTIONS:
    -a, --annotations <file>            Input annotations file (GFF3)
    -t, --feature-type <str>            Feature type to count [default: exon]
    -i, --id <str>                      Feature attribute to use as the feature identity [default: gene_id]
        --min-mapping-quality <u8>      Minimum mapping quality to consider an alignment [default: 10]
    -o, --output <file>                 Output destination for feature counts
        --strand-specification <str>    Strand specification [default: auto]  [possible values: none, forward, reverse,
                                        auto]
        --threads <uint>                Force a specific number of threads

ARGS:
    <bam>    Input alignment file
```

The default output is a tab-delimited text file with two columns: the feature
identifier (string) and the number of reads (integer) from the input alignment
that overlap it. This file is compatible as output from htseq-count, meaning it
includes statistics in the trailer.

### `normalize`

`normalize` takes raw counts and normalizes them by gene length, meaning the
annotations used for quantification must be the same given here. Two
normalization methods are available: FPKM for single sample normalization and
TPM for across samples normalization (default).

Typically, this is only used when a sample was previously quanitifed, e.g.,
using `noodles-squab quantify` or `htseq-count`.

```
noodles-squab-normalize
Normalize counts

USAGE:
    noodles-squab normalize [OPTIONS] <counts> --annotations <file>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -a, --annotations <file>    Input annotations file (GFF3)
    -t, --feature-type <str>    Feature type to count [default: exon]
    -i, --id <str>              Feature attribute to use as the feature identity [default: gene_id]
        --method <str>          Quantification normalization method [default: tpm]  [possible values: fpkm, tpm]

ARGS:
    <counts>    Input counts file
```

The output is a tab-delimited text file with two columns: the feature
identifier (string) and the normalized value (double).

## Examples

### Count features (exons by gene ID)

```
$ noodles-squab \
    --verbose \
    quantify \
    --annotations annotations.gff3.gz \
    --output sample.counts.tsv \
    sample.bam
```

### Count featues (genes by gene name)

```
$ noodles-squab \
    --verbose \
    quantify \
    --annotations annotations.gff3.gz \
    --feature-type gene \
    --id gene_name \
    --output sample.fpkm.tsv \
    sample.bam
```

### Normalize counts in FPKM (exons by gene ID)

```
$ noodles-squab \
    --verbose \
    normalize \
    --method fpkm \
    --annotations annotations.gff3.gz \
    sample.counts.tsv \
    > sample.fpkm.tsv
```

## Limitations

  * Counts are taken only as the union of matched feature sets, i.e., reads that
    overlap any part of the feature is considered once.
  * For paired end alignments, a read that matches itself before a mate is
    found replaces the previously known record.
